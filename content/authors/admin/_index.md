<!-- Hello! I am Kaiping Zhang (张开平), an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political Science at Tsinghua University](https://www.dps.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1180/2342.htm), where I also hold the position of Deputy Director of the [Center for Data Governance](http://thucdg.com/index). I was a visiting scholar at the [Harvard-Yenching Institute](https://www.harvard-yenching.org/person/kaiping-zhang/) during the academic year 2024-2025.

Obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Communication at Stanford University](https://comm.stanford.edu), I explore how communication processes—such as propaganda, deliberation, and social information sharing—shape Chinese public opinion, policymaking, and geopolitics. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, my research combines qualitative analysis with innovative quantitative methods to explore the complex interplay between technology, politics, and society in a rapidly evolving world. Beyond my academic work, I have a deep passion for literature, history, psychology, and sociology, continuously drawing inspiration from these fields to enrich my perspective.

My scholarly contributions have appeared in peer-reviewed journals, including *Political Psychology*, *Contemporary Politics*, and *Journal of Contemporary China*. My work has also been featured in top-tier Chinese journals such as the *CASS Journal of Political Science and Journalism and Communication*. Before joining Tsinghua University, I worked as a Research Associate at the [Center for Deliberative Democracy](https://deliberation.stanford.edu) at Stanford University and participated in multiple Deliberative Pollings led by [Professor James Fishkin](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/james-fishkin) across the world. I have received several awards, notably the Top Paper Award from the Division of Political Communication at the 73rd Annual Conference of the International Communication Association.  -->
Hello! I am Kaiping Zhang (张开平), a tenured Associate Professor of Political Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn/sssen/info/1055/1400.htm). I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Communication at Stanford University](https://comm.stanford.edu/), and currently serve as Director of the [Center for Data Governance](http://thucdg.com/index) in Tsinghua. Before joining Tsinghua University, I worked as a Research Associate at the [Center for Deliberative Democracy](https://www.harvard-yenching.org/person/kaiping-zhang/) at Stanford University and participated in multiple Deliberative Pollings led by [Professor James Fishkin](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/james-fishkin) across the world. During the 2024-2025 academic year, I was a visiting scholar at the [Harvard-Yenching Institute](https://www.harvard-yenching.org/person/kaiping-zhang/).

My research focuses on Chinese politics, political communication, and deliberative democracy. Using media discourse as an analytical lens, I study state–society relations in contemporary China, citizen participation, and China’s engagement with the world. Methodologically, I integrate quantitative analysis with experimental designs and computational approaches. Beyond my social scientific work, I maintain a deep interest in literature and history, which continually inform and enrich my scholarly perspective.

My scholarly work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals, including *Political Psychology*, *Social Science & Medicine*, and *Journal of Contemporary China*, among others. My work has also been featured in top-tier Chinese journals. I have received several awards, notably the Tang Zhongying Outstanding Junior Scholar and Top Paper Award from the Division of Political Communication at the 73rd Annual Conference of the International Communication Association.
