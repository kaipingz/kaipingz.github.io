Hello! I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Political Science at Tsinghua University](https://www.dps.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1180/2342.htm), where I also hold the position of Deputy Director of the [Center for Data Governance](http://thucdg.com/index). Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the [Harvard-Yenching Institute](https://www.harvard-yenching.org/person/kaiping-zhang/) during the academic year 2024-2025.

Obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Communication at Stanford University](https://comm.stanford.edu), I explore how communication processes--such as propaganda, deliberation, and social information sharing facilitated by digital technologies--shape public opinion, policymaking, and international relations.without the facilitation of digital technologies, shape Chinese politics, steer public opinion, shape political narratives, and impact policy decisions. Employing an interdisciplinary approach that integrates political science, communication studies, and computational social science, my research utilizes both qualitative and innovative quantitative methods to illuminate the intricate interplay between technology, politics, and society. 

My scholarly contributions have appeared in peer-reviewed journals, including *Political Psychology*, *Contemporary Politics*, and *China Review*. My work has also been featured in top-tier Chinese journals such as the *CASS Journal of Political Science and Journalism and Communication*. Before joining Tsinghua University, I worked as a Research Associate at the [Center for Deliberative Democracy](https://deliberation.stanford.edu) at Stanford University and participated in multiple Deliberative Pollings led by [Professor James Fishkin](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/people/james-fishkin) across the world. I have received several awards, notably the Top Paper Award from the Division of Political Communication at the 73rd Annual Conference of the International Communication Association.
