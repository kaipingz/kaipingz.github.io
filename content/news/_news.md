<!-- August 11-15, 2025 | Tsinghua University in Beijing, China and the International University of Japan in Minami Uonuma, Niigata, Japan

Participedia School 2025 Rio - China
Intelligent and digital technologies have emerged as a major force in reshaping democratic institutions and public governance worldwide. Currently, over ten cities are piloting digital local democracy or participatory initiatives across China. To understand these innovative practices, examine emerging issues and tensions in the development of public digital infrastructures, and identify areas of improvement, we are pleased to announce Participedia School on Digital Democracy: Exploring New Forms of Democratic Representation, Participation, and Governance (August 11-15, 2025). The Participedia School program will span over 40 hours across 4 days, and two countries (China and Japan).

Participedia School 2025 on Digital Democracy aims to:
1. Empower the Next Generation of Researchers: Offer aspiring scholars and practitioners in digital democracy an immersive experience, engaging with the latest innovations, research, and real-world applications in the field.
2. Explore Emerging Challenges and Opportunities: Examine key issues arising from recent digital democracy initiatives, such as creating E-forums to foster greater public participation and enhance the quality of deliberative processes. The program also delves into how digital tools can expand and reimagine traditional electoral representation frameworks.
3. Foster Innovation and Collaboration: Identify critical gaps and opportunities for collaboration in addressing pressing challenges, including combating digital fraud, ensuring equitable access, and enhancing trust and transparency in democratic systems.

### Week Overview
